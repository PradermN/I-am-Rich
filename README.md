# 💎 I Am Rich — My First Flutter Project

This is my very first project built with **Flutter**, created as a learning exercise to explore the basics of mobile app development and environment setup.  

## 🎯 Objectives

The goal of this project was to:

- Understand how to **create and run a Flutter project**  
- Learn to work with both **Android Studio** and **Visual Studio Code**  
- Practice using some of the **core Flutter widgets**, including:  
  - `MaterialApp`  
  - `Scaffold`  
  - `AppBar`  
  - `Center`  
  - `Color`  
  - `Image`  
- Run and test the app on a configured **Android emulator**

## 📱 Description

The app simply displays an image of a diamond with the title **“I am Rich”**, serving as an introduction to Flutter’s widget-based UI system.
